- Logic Statement Exercises:

```
"Today is raining and the grass is wet"
let p = "Today is raining"
let q = "Grass is wet"

Conjunction: `p ^ q` : "Today is raining AND the grass is wet"
Disjunction: `p v q` : "Today is raining OR the grass is wet"
Negation: `~p v ~q` : "Today is not raining OR the grass is not wet"

"I won't buy toilet paper and carry it with me"
let p = "I will buy toilet paper"
let q = "Carry it with me"

Conjunction: `~p ^ q` : "I won't buy toilet paper AND carry it with me"
Disjunction: `~p v q` : "I won't buy toilet paper OR carry it with me"
Negation: `p v ~q` : "I will buy toilet paper OR carry it with me"

"Neither Jane or I drink"
let j = "Jane drink"
let i = "I drink"

Conjunction: `~j v ~i` : "Neither Jane OR I drink"
Disjunction: `~j ^ ~i` : "Neither Jane AND I drink"
Negation: `j ^ i` : "Jane AND I drink"

"The Cannucks did not win or the game is going longer"
let p = "The Canucks won"
let q = "The game is going longer"

Conjunction: `~p v q` : "The Canucks did not win OR the game is going longer"
Disjunction: `~p ^ q` : "The Canucks did not win AND the game is going longer"
Negation: `p ^ ~q` : "The Canucks won AND the game is not going longer"
