- Logic
- Logic Statement Exercises:

```
"Today is raining and the grass is wet"
let p = "Today is raining"
let q = "Grass is wet"

Conjunction: `p ^ q` : "Today is raining AND the grass is wet"
Disjunction: `p v q` : "Today is raining OR the grass is wet"
Negation: `~p v ~q` : "Today is not raining OR the grass is not wet"

"I won't buy toilet paper and carry it with me"
let p = "I will buy toilet paper"
let q = "Carry it with me"

Conjunction: `~p ^ q` : "I won't buy toilet paper AND carry it with me"
Disjunction: `~p v q` : "I won't buy toilet paper OR carry it with me"
Negation: `p v ~q` : "I will buy toilet paper OR carry it with me"

"Neither Jane or I drink"
let j = "Jane drink"
let i = "I drink"

Conjunction: `~j v ~i` : "Neither Jane OR I drink"
Disjunction: `~j ^ ~i` : "Neither Jane AND I drink"
Negation: `j ^ i` : "Jane AND I drink"

"The Cannucks did not win or the game is going longer"
let p = "The Canucks won"
let q = "The game is going longer"

Conjunction: `~p v q` : "The Canucks did not win OR the game is going longer"
Disjunction: `~p ^ q` : "The Canucks did not win AND the game is going longer"
Negation: `p ^ ~q` : "The Canucks won AND the game is not going longer"

- Application Plan
  1. Register a domain in godaddy
  2. Use Route 53 to configure the DNS
    * NS entries: ns-183.awsdns-22.com. ns-1088.awsdns-08.org. ns-1970.awsdns-54.co.uk. ns-744.awsdns-29.net.
    * Run DNS checker
    * Created an apex entry
    * Created an www entry
  3. Use Elastic Beanstalk as the Pipeline management
    * Open the tutorial
    * Created the local app
    * Tested it locally
    * eb init
      * eb init -p python-3.6 mydevopsbc --region cac-central-1
    * Installed EB CLI
      * pip install awsebcli --upgrade
    * Deploy
  4. Use git as version control 
- Pipelines examples

    - Domains
      - DNS management
    - Load balancer
    - Security (firewall, SSL, keys, ssh, etc.)
    - Version the environment
    - Host versions pre deploy
  - Application
    - Python
    - Flask
    - pip
  - Development
